# Economic growth
This repository houses files for Excel and Matlab, which process data from Penn World Table (PWT 10.0) and Maddison Project Database (MPD 2020) to replicate figures and run regressions as in Acemoglu (2009) and Mankiw, Romer y Weil (1992).

The repository has the following files:

       PWT14032021.xlsx
       DataBaseGrowth14032021.xlsx      
       Graphs_GDPpc.m
       FitSolowData.m
       ols.m

*PWT14032021.xlsx*: data for replicating figures from Acemoglu's book.
*Graphs_GDPpc.m*: script to generate those figures. 

*DataBaseGrowth14032021.xlsx*: data for running regressions as in MRW's paper. I do not pretend to replicate exactly them since I use different data samples than that paper.
*FitSolowData.m*: script to generate OLS estimates (see "TablaX" object for the results).

*ols.m*: own function to run OLS regressions.
